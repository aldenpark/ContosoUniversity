# ContosoUniversity - CU2 Updates
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio

So the sections for 5-8 where interesting in how different we have done things in class, but also how similar to how I've done things in other languages.   The tutorial also didn't go into it much but I had never heard of Fluent API before and it feels like there's alot there for doing different things.  I liked the comparison for how to eager load and static loading, I'm far to used to doing it the eager loading way so I'll want to remmeber this comparison.  I like the ideas in the section 8, but I don't really like the way it was done.  I've seen other implementations and even built ones that where we had a history table instead.  But I can't help but feel using a date modified field and a trigger on the db when you go to update could do the same thing and be more efficient.
